# MegaLinter groups the same language / format linters on the same process to avoid locking
# issues if applying fixes. If that doesn't work as intended, disable this.
# Will significantly degrade performance.
PARALLEL: true

# Can be turned on in private repos to improve performance, but will output
# any secrets found in plain text to the console/log.
SKIP_LINTER_OUTPUT_SANITIZATION: false

# Should be set to false after the codebase has been scanned and all issues fixed.
# This will switch to only scanning new/changed files and can dramatically improve performance.
VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE: true

# When left unset will use all available cores.
# Leave commented out unless you need to restrict the resources available to the runner.
#PARALLEL_PROCESS_NUMBER: 4
